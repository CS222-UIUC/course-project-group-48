**Introduction**

Our project name is BeFake and it is a social media app that allows users to join groups and upload pictures of themselves completing certain focused challenges.  A 
new challenge will be generated each day and users will be able to view their other group member's posts as well. 

**Architecture**

Our app's backend is built using Golang and utilizes a
SQLite database in order to store our user's information while our app's frontend is built with Swift. 

**Installation**

To install and use our app, clone the repository in Xcode, and
click the run button. This will display the app and will allow the user to sign up or log into the app. 

**Group Roles**

Throughout the development of our app, we split up the work into a
frontend and a backend team. Anagha and Madhav worked on the frontend and learned Swift and app development while working with Xcode. Kelsi and Aryan worked on the
backend and learned how to build and store data in a database through SQLite. Overall, we were able to learn and grow throughout this project to create a final project
that we are proud of.
