**Introduction**

Our project name is BeFake and it is a social media app that allows users to join groups and upload pictures of themselves completing certain focused challenges.  A 
new challenge will be generated each day and users will be able to view their other group member's posts as well. While our app may seem to mimic the popular app BeReal, we created a project with more focused goals and challenges for enhanced user experience.

**Architecture**

Our app's backend is built using Golang and utilizes a
SQLite database in order to store our user's information while our app's frontend is built with Swift. 

**Installation**

To install and use our app, clone the repository in Xcode, and
click the run button. This will display the app and will allow the user to sign up or log into the app. 

**App Functionality** 

Our app has a login page that allows users to create a new account and sign in. Our app supports joining groups and uploading pictures. We also have a groups page that has the groups a user is part of, a feed page with the users' friends' posts, a profile page with the profile information of the user, and a settings page where a user can change information about their profile. We hope to continue adding more features to our app in the future.

**Group Roles**

Throughout the development of our app, we split up the work into a
frontend and a backend team. Anagha and Madhav worked on the frontend and learned Swift and app development while working with Xcode. Kelsi and Aryan worked on the
backend and learned how to build and store data in a database through SQLite. Overall, we were able to learn and grow throughout this project to create a final project
that we are proud of.
